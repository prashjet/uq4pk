    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 2D array (n,d)
    Samples from distribution P, which typically represents the true
    distribution.
    y : 2D array (m,d)
    Samples from distribution Q, which typically represents the approximate
    distribution.

    -------
    out : float
    The estimated Kullback-Leibler divergence D(P||Q).
